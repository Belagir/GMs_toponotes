# GM's toponotes

Load an image, place pins onto it and annotate them. Take notes tied to a battle map or a campaign map !

This software is currently under development, and as such still uses Godot's base UI skin and may have bugs.

Currently, what you can do with it includes :
 - load an image as a base for your file ;
 - add pins, and select an icon for it ;
 - edit the pin's associated note with a basic markdown syntax (only *emphasis*, **bold** and ***emphasis bold*** are supported right now) ;
 - save your work as a GM's toponotes file (the image is i√ßncluded within) ;
 - load a GM's toponotes file.

There is a splatter of issues that describes what comes next. But right now, I am on other projects and don't know when I will get to implement them.
